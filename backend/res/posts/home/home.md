# Welcome

Welcome to **Rendering Strategies for Web Apps**.
This is a place where developers can gather information about different rendering techniques used in modern web apps.
The site is structured as a blog which consists of a number of posts regarding rendering web apps.

The objectives of this blog are as follows:
* Provide an overview of the existing rendering strategies
* Find out what it takes to add server side rendering to web applications which were built as single page applications in a modern JavaScript frontend framework
* Compare the performance of different rendering strategies in different frameworks

The blog posts are listed on the left (or can be displayed by tapping / clicking the burger icon if you are on a small screen).
While they are largely independent from each other or include links to other passages where needed, it will make most sense to read them in the listed order (from top to bottom).

## About

My name is Markus Glutting, I am a Software Developer working at [sprylab](https://sprylab.com/).
I am currently studying Media Informatics (Master) at [HTW Berlin](https://www.htw-berlin.de/).
The curriculum includes the elaboration of two so-called [Independent Coursworks](https://imi-master.htw-berlin.de/studium/independent-coursework/).
Students are expected to find a topic which is connected to the course of study and work on that topic independently.
I chose *Rendering Strategies for Web Apps* as my topic and decided to publish the results in this blog.   
Independent Courseworks also need a supervisor who helps in case of questions and assesses the final results.
[Prof. Dr. Kleinen](http://home.htw-berlin.de/~kleinen/) kindly agreed to take on this role.

If you have any questions or remarks please do not hesitate to [send me an email](mailto:markus.glutting@student.htw-berlin.de).
Feel free to visit my other projects on [github](https://github.com/glutengo) or [medium](https://medium.com/@glutengo) if you are interested.
