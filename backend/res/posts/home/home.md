# Welcome

Welcome to **Rendering Strategies for Web Apps**.
This is a place where developers can gather information about different rendering techniques used in modern web apps.
The site is structured as a blog which consists of a number of posts regarding rendering web apps.

The objectives of this blog are as follows:
* Get an overview of what rendering strategies exist
* Find out what it takes to add Server Side Rendering to Web Applications which were built in a modern JavaScript frontend framework
* Compare the performance of different rendering strategies in different frameworks

## About

My name is Markus Glutting, I am a Software Developer working at [sprylab](https://sprylab.com/).
I am currently studying Media Informatics (Master) at [HTW Berlin](https://www.htw-berlin.de/).
The curriculum includes the elaboration of two so-called [Independent Coursworks](https://imi-master.htw-berlin.de/studium/independent-coursework/).
Students are expected to find a topic which is connected to the course of study and work on that topic independently.
I chose *Rendering Strategies for Web Apps* as my topic and decided to publish the results in this blog.   
Independent Courseworks also need a supervisor who helps in case of questions and assesses the final results.
[Prof. Dr. Kleinen](http://home.htw-berlin.de/~kleinen/) kindly agreed to take on this role.

If you have any questions or remarks please do not hesitate to [send me an email](mailto:markus.glutting@student.htw-berlin.de).
Feel free to visit my other projects on [github](https://github.com/glutengo) or [medium](https://medium.com/@glutengo) if you are interested.
